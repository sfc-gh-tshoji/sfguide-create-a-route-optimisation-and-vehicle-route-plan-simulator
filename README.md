# Create a Route Optimisation and Vehicle Route Plan Simulator

## Overview

This tutorial leverages the [Open Route Service](https://openrouteservice.org/) to optimise vehicle routes in order to distribute goods to chosen destinations on time.

The results are flexible in terms of location - you can choose to simulate routes from anywhere in the world.

The open route service is free to use but there are restrictions in the number of calls to the freely available api api.

If you need a solution  without imits, you may wish  to install the services inside a Snowpark Container.

Either way, Snowflake allows for creation of a fully interactive route simulator which will benefit many vehicle centric industries such as **retail**, **distribution**, **healthcare** and more.
